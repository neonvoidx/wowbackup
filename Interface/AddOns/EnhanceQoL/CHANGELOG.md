# Changelog

## [8.8.1] - 2026-03-04

### 🐛 Fixed

- Resource Bars (Druid): Fixed Cat/Bear shapeshift flicker in combat when combining `Show in` (form filters) with `Show when` visibility rules by merging form-based hides into the secure visibility driver.
- Mythic+ (Teleports): Added missing Haranir racial teleport `Rootwalking` (`1238686`) to class/race teleports (only shown for Haranir/Harronir).
- Shared Media (Performance): Fixed settings freezes with very large SharedMedia libraries by introducing a global, sorted media cache for `sound`/`font`/`border`/`statusbar`/`background` instead of rebuilding lists on each settings open.
- Shared Media (Live Updates): New media registrations now invalidate the relevant cache via the `LibSharedMedia_Registered` callback, so newly added sounds/fonts/textures appear without repeated full rescans.
- Settings Dropdowns: Reworked affected dropdown providers (including Mythic+ Bloodlust Tracker, Class Buff Reminder, UI/Aura/Food/Sound related settings) to consume cached values directly, preventing repeated per-open sorting and list reconstruction.
- Group Frames (Healer Buff Placement): Sometimes stale buffs were shown

### 🐛 Fixed

- Action Bars (Button text): Fixed a regression where custom keybind text colors could reset to default white/red after action state updates (for example during combat/range checks or key presses).

---

## [8.3.0] - 2026-02-27

### ✨ Added

- Unit Frames (Health): Added `Use health percent gradient` with configurable curve type (`Cosine`, `Linear`, `Step`) and up to 5 custom gradient points (each with percent + color). The max-health color remains driven by class/custom/default health color.

---

---

## [8.0.0] - 2026-02-27

### ⚠️ Important Profile Notice

- We changed how profile data is handled to make behavior more consistent and avoid unexpected overwrites when switching Edit Mode layouts.
- In rare cases after updating, some users may notice that parts of their layout-based setup look different than before.
- If that happens, please verify your active EQoL profile and re-import or restore your preferred profile setup once.
- Going forward, profile changes should be easier to understand and more predictable for users.

- Group Frames (Party/Raid): Added `/eqol hbp` as a quick shortcut to open the Healer Buff Placement editor, even outside Edit Mode.

## [7.15.0] - 2026-02-13

### ✨ Added

- Unit Frames (Auras): Added sliders to change aura border size and position.
- Unit Frames (Auras): Expanded the slider ranges for more control.
- UI: Added a `4K` login UI scaling preset (`0.3556`).

### 🐛 Fixed

- Resource Bars: Fixed a visual issue where one Holy Power divider could look out of place at certain UI scales.
- Resource Bars: New class/spec bars now keep the position and size from your saved global profile.
- Resource Bars: Edit Mode layouts are now separated by class, so switching classes/profiles no longer mixes bar positions and sizes.
- Resource Bars: Removed legacy layout fallback to prevent old shared layout data from overriding current class-specific settings.
- Action Bars: Added `Always hidden` to action bar visibility rules (including Stance Bar) and fixed Pet Action Bar/Stance Bar visibility resolution so both bars are reliably affected by visibility settings.

---

## [7.14.0] - 2026-02-13

---

## [7.13.2] - 2026-02-13

### 🐛 Fixed

- Forbidden table error fixes

---

## [7.13.1] - 2026-02-12

---

## [7.13.0] - 2026-02-12

### ✨ Added

### 🐛 Fixed

- Unit Frames: Border settings not working
- Unit Frames: Removed raid-style party leader icon hooks (`showLeaderIconRaidFrame`) to prevent taint involving `secureexecuterange`.

---

## [7.12.0] - 2026-02-11

### ✨ Added

- Unit Frames: Added configurable `Castbar strata` + `Castbar frame level offset` (Player/Target/Focus/Boss).
- Unit Frames: Added configurable `Level text strata` + `Level text frame level offset`.
- Unit Frames: Added optional `Party leader icon` indicator for Player/Target/Focus.

### ⚡ Performance

- Unit Frames: `setBackdrop`/`applyBarBackdrop` now run with style-diff caching, so unchanged backdrop styles are skipped instead of being reapplied every refresh.
- Unit Frames: Edit Mode registration now batches refresh requests and skips no-op anchor `onApply` refreshes, reducing load-time spikes during UF frame/settings registration.
- Health/Power percent: Removed some pcalls
- Drinks: Improved sorting
- Unit Frames: Health updates now cache absorb/heal-absorb values and refresh them on absorb events instead of querying absorb APIs every health tick.
- Unit Frames: `formatPercentMode` was moved out of `formatText` hot-path to avoid per-update closure allocations.
- Resource Bars: `configureSpecialTexture` now caches special atlas state (`atlas` + normalize mode) and skips redundant texture/color reconfiguration.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Tooltip: Fixed a rare error when hovering unit tooltips.
- Objective Tracker: Hiding of M+ timer fixed
- Unit Frames: Main frame strata fallback is now stable `LOW` (instead of inheriting Blizzard `PlayerFrame` strata), preventing addon interaction from unexpectedly forcing Player/Target/ToT/Focus frames to `MEDIUM`.
- LibButtonGlow Update - Secret error
- World Map Teleport: Fixed restricted-content taint (`ScrollBar.lua` secret `scrollPercentage`) by suppressing the EQoL teleport display mode/interactions while restricted.
