#### 🚀 Big one. Probably the biggest Keystone Polaris update shipped “under the hood” so far: tons of performance/loading work and internal cleanups, plus visible wins like Group Reminder and Season start/end warnings.
Please send feedback and bug reports, with a release this big, your reports really help.
Thanks again for being part of the Keystone Polaris journey, it really helps me stay motivated and keep improving the addon!
