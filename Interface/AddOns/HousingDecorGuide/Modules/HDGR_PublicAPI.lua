-- HDGR -- Public API
-- ============================================================================
-- THE ONLY SURFACE ANOTHER ADDON MAY TOUCH. Everything else in HDG is internal
-- and moves without notice; what is declared here is a contract, versioned, and
-- changed by adding rather than by editing.
--
-- WHY IT EXISTS. Aegis's guild blueprint library can tell a member they are
-- missing 35 pieces of a build, and it deliberately knows nothing about where
-- decor comes from -- that is a catalog, a vendor table and a routing engine,
-- all of which live here. Rather than copy any of that into Aegis, Aegis hands
-- over what the SERVER told it and HDG does the part it owns.
--
-- THE CALLER IS NOT TRUSTED TO BE CORRECT, only to be well-meaning. Every
-- argument is checked at this boundary, because a wrong shape from another
-- addon must produce a refusal rather than an error inside HDG's store -- the
-- player would see a HDG error and blame HDG.
--
-- CONSUMERS MUST DEGRADE. HDG is not a dependency of anything that calls this:
-- the calling addon is expected to check `HousingDecorGuide.API` exists and to
-- carry on without it, so nothing here may be required for that addon to work.

-- HDG IS A GLOBAL HERE, not a varargs table -- the convention every other HDGR
-- module follows (`HDG = HDG or {}` with no `local`). Taking the varargs table
-- instead shadowed it with an empty one, so every HDG.* read inside this file
-- came back nil and the first live click threw on HousingCatalogObserver.
HDG = HDG or {}

local API = { version = 1 }
HDG.API = API

-- PUBLISHED UNDER THE FULL NAME, not the terse `HDG` global. Another addon
-- reaching for a two-letter global is asking for a collision, and this handle
-- says whose API it is. Aegis reads exactly this.

-- ROUTE A BLUEPRINT'S MISSING PIECES TO A SHOPPING LIST
-- ============================================================================
-- req = {
--   shareCode = "<24 base64 chars>",   -- identity; re-routing UPSERTS its list
--   name      = "Lakeside Retreat",    -- what the list is called
--   entries   = {                      -- straight off the game's own manifest
--     { contentType = 3, recordID = 12345, numMissing = 7 }, ...
--   },
-- }
--
-- Returns  routed, skipped   on success -- how many items landed on the list,
--                            and how many could not be resolved to something
--                            buyable (not in the catalog yet, or structural).
-- Returns  nil, reason       when it will not run: "bad-request", "not-ready".
--
-- IDENTITY IS THE SHARE CODE, matching HDG's own blueprint routing: the list is
-- keyed `blueprint:<shareCode>`, so a member who routes the same build twice
-- refreshes one list instead of collecting duplicates.
--
-- NOT EVERY MISSING PIECE IS BUYABLE. Rooms, house types and fixtures are
-- structural -- there is no vendor for them -- and a decor row the catalog has
-- not baked yet has no itemID. Both are counted as `skipped` and reported to
-- the caller rather than silently dropped, because "35 missing" turning into a
-- list of 23 with no explanation is the kind of arithmetic players screenshot.
