-- HDG.Projects.FloorMap
-- ============================================================================
-- Per-floor occupancy + projection, DERIVED from version.rooms (the SSoT).
-- Nothing is stored: a garden is ONE record on its floor and GetFloors gives its
-- vertical span, so both the cells it blocks above AND the ghost it renders above
-- are recomputed on demand. This is why what-if versions need no extra copy --
-- the map derives from whichever version's rooms are passed in.
--
--   OccupiedCells(rooms, floor, exclude?)  -> { ["x,y"]=true }   (collision)
--   ProjectedRooms(rooms, floor)           -> { {roomID,shape,cell}, ... } (render ghosts)
--   CanMoveTo(rooms, roomID, x, y)         -> bool                (drag/move guard)
--
-- SECTIONS model (owner-ruled + capture-verified 2026-08-10, solver spec SS10):
-- CAPTURED stairs/tall arrive as one real record per floor (each occupies only
-- its own floor, span 1); gardens are a single record that projects up 3 floors
-- (open sky above). PLANNER-placed stair shapes are a single record stamped
-- floors=2 (GetPlannedSpan) so the what-if canvas projects them like the game
-- placement action would create them; "Expand Stairwell up" bumps that field.
