    .. "Recording is manual now. During the Sermon, press a quarter key or click the quarter "

    .. "echoes play your recording back. Waves you skip show as unknown.\n\n"

    .. "addon remembers with you.\n\n"
    .. "While the ground still shows the safe quarter, tell the addon where you went. "
    .. "Press that quarter's key, or click the quarter on the room view. One answer per "
    .. "wave. The countdown window says which wave it is waiting for and how long you "
    .. "have, because the boss's own channel gives away the timing.\n\n"
    .. "Answers land in order, so a late one still counts. Miss the third wave and your "
    .. "next press takes the third slot, which means two quick taps get you level again. "
    .. "You cannot answer a wave that has not happened yet, and a wave left blank when "
    .. "the echoes begin can still be filled right up until its own echo plays. Anything "
    .. "you never answer stays unknown.\n\n"
    .. "If naming quarters in the scramble is the hard part, the settings can switch the keys "
    .. "to relative turns, the same reading the arrow and the voice use. A press then says the "
    .. "move you made rather than the place you ended up: north for straight through the boss, "
    .. "east and west for the two sides. The first wave still names its quarter, since there "
    .. "is nothing behind it to turn from, and that is where the route starts. South answers "
    .. "nothing after that, the safe spot never lands twice in the same place. Marking and "
    .. "calling need a quarter, so they switch off while it is on.\n\n"
    .. "When the echoes start, the room view lights the quarter you are due in green and the "
    .. "one after it yellow. The arrow shows the move to make from where the last wave "
    .. "left you and the voice calls it out loud.\n\n"
    .. "The arrow and the voice both talk as if you are looking at the boss in the middle "
    .. "of the room. Forward means straight through him. Left and right are your left and "
    .. "right from there, and stay means the route keeps you where you are. Turn "
    .. "your back on him and they will be backwards, so keep him in front of you.\n\n"
    .. "Your four keys live in the settings panel and in the game's Key Bindings screen "
    .. "under AddOns. Each quarter on the room view shows its own key. The quarters wear "
    .. "markers rather than compass letters. drop the matching world markers in the room. Click a marker out of combat "
    .. "to change it. Between pulls, /azt replay walks "
    .. "the last route again at "
    .. "its real speed, /azt review says what it recorded, and /azt practice runs a whole "
